Excellent Question” Checklist
Hi There! Use the following checklist to ask an excellent question in the course forums when you have a problem related to python programming. Either myself or someone else will be there to help you as quick as a flash!

1) Make a great question title ☐
a. I have added the [Help] Tag at the start of my title ☐
b. My Question title is Clear and descriptive and it is obvious what the problem is ☐

2) My Question has a complete description ☐
a. I have written down the observed behaviour (What has happened) ☐
b. I have written down the expected behaviour (What was supposed to happen) ☐
c. I have added a link to my code using gist.github.com ☐
d. I have mentioned what I think the problem might be and the location. ☐
e. I have provided a list of at least 3 things that I have tried to solve the problem ☐
f. My Description uses full sentences with correct grammar and punctuation ☐

3) I have included other relevant information
a. Error messages in full ☐
b. Version of python used ☐
c. Screen shots where necessary ☐ 



How to ask Question in a Community Example:
    
Title: 
    
    [Help] Answer not being shown on screen when running Python script 

Description: 
    
    1) Observed Behaviour - 
    Script runs successfully but answer doesnt show up
    
    2) Expected Behaviour - 
    I expected the answer 2 to show up when I ran the script.
    
    3) Link to Code: #(Use gist.github) - 
    https://gist.github.com/laharl143/2b3072c1ebc8245a182800355fcc3955
    
    4) Where I think the problem is-
    There must be something different between script and the shell
    It worked in the shell...lines 1-2 hold the issue
    Is something missing?
    
    5) What I have tried -
    I tried running the script with different numbers. No difference.
    
    6) Errors and Warnings 
    None
    
    7) Version info
    3.5.2
    
    8) Screenshots
    N/A
